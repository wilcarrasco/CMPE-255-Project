# CMPE-255-Project

### Team Name: The Ocho

### Team members: David Montes, Aaron Choi, Wil Carrasco

## Project Tile: 
Clustering Individual Household Electric Power Consumption and Future
Consumption Regression Analysis.

## Description: 
Our group proposes to use the Individual household electric power consumption
data set to look for power consumption trends over time. We plan on clustering the data using
descriptive methods to discover patterns and trends. Applying predictive methods such as
regression we plan to predict future power consumption.

# Deliverables

Project Report
------------
- Report should not exceed 10 pages, with font size at least 10(additional details if needed can be included in an Appendix. However, the data in the appendix will not contribute to/against your final grade and should be only informative.)
 - A project report template has been included in the Appendix. You need to update/adjust the template to your project’s focus and details.

Presentation
------------
Presentation slides should be uploaded to Canvas. All team members need to present some part of the talk. Depending on the type of the project, you can include a short demo of your prototype, but the demo counts as part of your presentation and no additional time will be allocated. Each team will have 10-15 minutes to present.

Code & Binary
------------
You will need to create and maintain a public github repository of your project. Your project distribution files should contain the following:
1. Complete source code (be sure that your source code is fully documented and easy to read), including data pre-processing scripts.
2. Binary files (e.g., executables, DLLs, Class files) or other components necessary to run your program.
3. Readme file containing instructions on how to compile, install, and/or run your program.
4. A small sample of the test data that can be used for evaluation of your system, in addition to the full dataset you used in your “production
